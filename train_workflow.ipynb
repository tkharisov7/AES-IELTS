As an example, in some countries, government is banning selling of such beverages in market. Furthermore, young child are more prone to attract such kind of products and so it will impact more on their health also.

I totally agree with this because we are living in the era of digitalization. This essay will discuss the reasons for this development in detail.\\nThe first reason is that everything is becoming digitalized. From the traditional work to our social life everything has been shifted in the purview of living a tale digitally. For instance, the rise of coronavirus has perpetually led to a life we would not have imagined otherwise. People are refraining from visiting any shops physically as they could be infected with the fatal virus anytime. Resulting to closure of shops and stores as a considerable increase in living digital lives.\\nAnother reasoning behind the ideology is that we are leading busy career-led life. People nowadays, do not have time to travel to a shop or store and waste their crucial hours selecting an outfit they were planning to wear for the office meeting they have not prepared content presentation for, yet. To illustrate, youtubers and other challenging new media professions demand content creation along with utilization of even a minute on the clock which traditional shopping will be unable to achieve. Which is why the more the busy life one person is having, the more the person would not prefer using the traditional way to shop for clothes or necessities.\\nTo conclude, the reasons why I agree that towns and cities will see shutting of shops due to online shopping is because of soaring digital usage everywhere and busier challenging careers.',\n","  'In this contemporary era, large corporations are replacing small businesses leading to a steady decline in their numbers. In my opinion, large corporation is the way to go for the beneficial future of the potential buyers and hence the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages.\\nDespite the minimal drawbacks, I believe the functioning of large companies would be advantageous to the average person. Firstly, multinational companies require large staff for their functioning. This would produce plethora of job for the masses and thus creating employment within various sectors of the industry. Secondly, the goods sold will have to go through a rigorous quality check which will result in quality assured products. To illustrate this, one of my friends recently bought a room heater from a local vendor at a bargain and within the next week, there was a fault in heater and due to which he had a hard time getting it replaced\\nAdmittedly, there are some minor drawbacks to this as well. One problem is that there is a price hike on goods sold in the market. This increase in price is due to the various taxes in these companies resulting in the increased prices of the product. Another possible issue is that relating to the environmental concern. This is due to the high pollution ranging from exhaust fumes and toxic irritants from these corporations coupled with increased congestion on the roads due to traffic, this all creates difficulty for the older inhabitants and children living in the area\\nIn conclusion, when large stores replace small corner shops, there are some downsides to it. However, the positives of a quality assured product and the rise in employment suffice to overpower those.\\nDo you have an essay on this topic?

Probably because people feel the need to learn their past better, and also believe it has some legal value. Furthermore, such information can usually be obtained from family members and local governing bodies.\\nMost people live isolated lives, learning more about their homes makes them aware of their family roots. Such learnings will improve their cultural connect and prevent people from feeling alienated. For instance, Steve jobs once said, “We would not know who we are, unless we do not know where we came from.” Similarly, it is essential to have knowledge regarding the legal ownership of one’s home. A sound understanding of inheritance laws regarding homes can prevent the possibility of family disputes.\\nAlthough most people would have hearsay knowledge of their homes, it is best obtained from reliable sources. Usually, these include well-meaning senior members of a household. They always have sound knowledge regarding the historical backdrop of homes and are always eager to share their knowledge and experience. Further information can be obtained from the government, in the community. Federal offices house papers regarding inheritance of property etc., which can be useful to verify the legality of housing documents. For example, while I was house hunting, I enquired about the safety standards of the apartment from a local corporation office. I was surprised and pleased to know the technical details that they provided, which made by job easier.\\nTherefore, to conclude, a phenomenon of people enquiring regarding about the history of their homes is on the rise. It is likely because people have realized the significance of family traditions and are equally interested in keeping their property safe from land disputes. Furthermore, I think the aforementioned details can be easily gathered from sources in the family and the community.

Most of items are purchased online by more number of persons. I personally believe that this is the negative development.\\nTo begin with, there are a number of adverse effects to online shopping like poor quality of products, loss of business for local shop owners and profit, which is generated from purchasing items online, goes to only single company. First, due to doing online shopping regional store owners maybe lose their earning opportunities. For example, prior to this trend people bought all things from the regional market but, in present time, most of people are buying products online. Due to this regional store owner/traders are suffering. They may lose their earning opportunities and might not be able to do some other occupation. In addition, we had to buy a particular thing from specific provincial stores on the contrary, in online purchasing all the items are available at one platform. Because of this, all the profit generated by selling products goes to alone single organization.\\nFurthermore, there are more demerits also like replacement/return processes are lengthy which are not in local shops. Sometimes people get poor quality items than they marketed. Consumers are cheated by those online platforms also. For instance, recently there is news that one person ordered iPhone but received only bricks in the box. On the other hand, there are some beneficial sides too. Firstly, for buying products customers do not need to go anywhere because they get things at their doorstep. Shopping things online is time saving as well as cost effective. For example, a number of discounts are available on products and online shopping platforms like ‘Flipkart’ and ‘Amazon’ do a number of festival sales in which consumers \\xa0buy products at lower price than local shops.\\nIn conclusion, there are numerous beneficial sides of purchasing things online like customers get items at their doorstep, cost effective and more discounts on things. However, in my opinion adverse sides of online shopping are more and it affects the business of local shop owners and only single organization can get the profit which is generated from buying products online. Consequently, customers should keep both views in mind prior to purchasing things online.\\nDo you have an essay on this topic?

Beneficial as I think the natural resources are, I would agree with the argument that we should no longer use them as daily-life needs.\\nFirst of all, chemical and biological engineering have immensely benefitted the food industry. Recently, scientists have introduced a good many brand-new artificial kinds of food, such as meat and vegetable, and nutritious substances like vitamins or protein. Besides the requirement of nutrition, present day witnesses the advent of the hybridization of new plants, leading to the replacement of animal materials.\\xa0\\nSecondly, the humanization is one of the main topics of society’s concern.

Some people believe that increasing the duration of prison sentences can be helpful or instrumental in reducing the crime rate while others insist that there are better solutions to reduce crime. In my opinion, longer prison sentences are an effective solution for severe crimes such as murder or rape while other severe crimes can be tackled by taking alternative measures.\\nThe magnitude of crime should decide the kind of punishment given for that crime. The crimes that have higher severity level should not be taken lightly and punishments for such crimes should be strict in order to prevent people from engaging in these crimes. For instance, crimes such as murder and rape show extreme levels of cruelty and hence, lifetime imprisonment should be the minimum punishment for these acts. It can be dreadful for a person to spend a major part of his life in jail and hence, longer prison sentences might be useful to lower the crime rate. If the duration of sentences is only a few months, such crimes will never be taken seriously and rapes and murders will become more frequent.\\nOn the other hand, giving long imprisonment would not be an ideal solution for acts which are less serious such as robbery or breaking traffic rules. People can be fined for jumping a red light or over-speeding. Also, for crimes like robbery and pick pocketing, short term imprisonment is sufficient. People could also be released on warnings in such cases. Additionally, the governing bodies ought to take necessary steps to reduce poverty. In developing countries, the reason for the majority of the crimes is poverty. Children who suffer from starvation and lack of basic facilities become pick-pocketers or robbers. Thus, providing basic facilities and food to people below poverty line can be helpful in reducing the crime rate.\\nIn conclusion, increased duration of prison sentences may reduce the crime rate since that will make criminals spend a major span of their life in jails. On the other hand, alternative solutions such as reducing poverty may be helpful in decreasing the crimes such as thefts and robberies. In my opinion, longer imprisonments should be given only for the severe crimes.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'It is believed by many people that it is better to take preventive measures than to treat diseases as it is quite expensive. I agree with this statement because if preventive measures are taken on time there are fewer chances of complications and hence both money and lives can be saved.\\nPeople are less conscious about their health and as a result they end up having health problems. Hospitals charge immense amount of money due to which people are afraid of getting hospitalized. In order to avoid medical expense, people should be aware of their unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking and eating fast food. Once self-awareness is generated, lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet and fitness programs can be adopted which can decrease the chances of falling sick.\\nVarious diseases are curable at home if taken care of. Mild medical problems such as muscle pain and joint pain can be treated at home easily by home remedies. Hence, it is necessary to take any signs and symptoms seriously and act upon them as early as possible under medical supervision. One evident benefit of doing so is reducing the expense. Moreover, the severity of the disease can be reduced and thus lives can be saved.\\nTo sum up, preventive measures can make a huge difference in saving a life. In other words, it is better to act before hand than to regret later. Life is priceless and therefore people should take their health seriously as this practice can save their time and money.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'Many animal species are about to disappear due to human activities.

In addition, human greed and interference through poaching have further threatened the existence of wild animals.\\nSeveral steps can be taken at governmental and societal levels to preserve the wildlife. The government can keep a strict watch on activities like poaching and hunting. Furthermore, development should not be at the expense of nature. Wildlife sanctuaries and parks should be established and maintained to protect the endangered species. Lastly, products made of animal body parts should be boycotted. For example, if people stop buying these products, the demand will decrease and hence, there will be a fall in production.\\nIn conclusion, people should always remember that man is a part of nature, not its master. In the end, it is up to the humans to decide whether to co-habit the environment with other wild animals or put their own survival at risk by destroying other forms of life.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'Consumption and sales are crucial for the growth of any manufacturing organization and advertisement plays an important role in this. While some individuals are of the opinion that these advertisements convince us to purchase things that are of little use to us, others believe that these media campaigns assist us to lead a good life. I strongly agree with the argument that advertisements play a key role in enhancing our living standard.\\nFirstly, nowadays everybody is so much busy in their life that nobody has the luxury of time to learn about new things by visiting the stores. Advertisement acts as a savior by showing us the things which are essential in our life. For example, toothpaste is essential for maintaining dental hygiene and now many companies have launched herbal toothpastes that do not contain any chemicals. Only through advertisements can consumers learn about such things.\\nSecondly, media campaigns of the product generate curiosity and awareness regarding it and assist people to take advantage of them. People will be more knowledgeable and impart their knowledge to others who are not so aware. Major diseases or any other incident can be prevented when somebody has adequate information about them and that is possible through proper campaigning.\\nThirdly, when a company makes more sales it will pay more taxes and the government will have money to spend on vital areas like education, healthcare and infrastructure. This indirect method will also directly impact the lives of millions of people and create prosperity all around.\\nIn conclusion, adverts do not force anyone to buy anything. Instead, they create awareness and help us make informed decisions about the products that will improve our lives.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'Due to the rise in long working schedules and stressful lifestyle, more and more people are suffering from sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep in day to day life can lead to serious issues such as mental fatigue and loss of endurance. Following strict daily schedules and regular exercise are effective ways to overcome this problem.\\nSleep deprivation has several impacts on the physical and mental well-being of the body. One of the main problems of not getting enough sleep is fatigue. Fatigue affects alertness and reduces the productivity of people. Lack of sleep has negative impact on people’s immunity and increases their probability of getting affected by various illnesses. It also affects their mental health. A study has shown that the people not having enough sleep are more likely to get depressed. Anxiety tends to be detrimental and can lead to some serious consequences.\\nThere are several steps to overcome this issue. Being pro-active, making a routine schedule and following it every day have helped many people. Moreover, this helps in balancing both work and personal life. Another effective way is to perform exercise regularly. Everyday work-out will help in developing physical fitness and mental stability. Exercise sessions can gradually be more intensive to ensure muscles are drained. This boosts metabolism and also helps them to get better sleep.\\nIn conclusion, lack of sleep affects people’s health and productivity. However, this problem can be resolved to a great extent by ensuring better work life balance and following a fitness routine.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'It is believed by some that cities are the perfect places to raise their children; however, others claim that they prefer their kids or offspring to grow up in rural areas. This essay will discuss both the views and explain why it is vital for the young ones to be raised in the cities.\\nOn the one hand, rural locations are preferred by some individuals because of the quality environment they provide. That is to say, young people grow up healthy in these areas due to low toxic air levels, which allow them to stay fit without any detrimental health issues in the future. For example, a magazine report stated that respiratory problems were not observed in 70% of the children raised in the countryside unlike the city children. Furthermore, they are not under constant academic pressure. In other words, parents and teachers do not put them under too much pressure to perform their homework or other extracurricular activities; consequently, they enjoy their childhood to the fullest. Therefore, children raised in villages can lead a healthy lifestyle.\\nOn the other hand, there are myriad reasons for people to think that city life is best for their children. Firstly, metropolises are equipped with excellent academic institutions which provide high-quality academic knowledge as well as practical knowledge. Having advanced learning materials in the institutions encourages them to be creative and sharpens their psychological state. A survey conducted by a newspaper, for instance, reported that a significant number of students from metropolises take part in international competitions every year. Additionally, non-academic subjects can also be easily learned by the young ones based on their interests; all of these allow children to develop physically and mentally. Thus, cities provide comprehensive education which assists them to have a better future in the later years.\\nIn conclusion, despite the healthy environment and tension-free education the rural areas offer, I believe that children raised in the cities are more likely to be equipped with excellent academic skills, which ultimately help them to have improved career prospects.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'Since there is a vast majority of students who find it difficult to understand subjects like maths and philosophy, some people argue that they must be elective, not mandatory. However, I strongly disagree with this.\\nTo start with, everyone has to do some mathematical calculations in their everyday life. One requires the knowledge of addition, subtraction, multiplication and even division for managing their budget. Besides this a decent understanding of mathematical concepts is essential to understand science and commerce. On top of it, competitive exams always have a section dedicated to this and hence students who do not learn maths at school cannot pass these exams. Years of laborious practice is a must to crack the exams; thus, students should start preparing right from school by learning maths.\\nOn the other hand, philosophy gives us insights into life as it broadens our understanding of life, morals and values. Religious and spiritual knowledge, in particular, is highly philosophical. If a child learns this at the school, they will become spiritually and intellectually awakened. It inculcates empathy in them and it is an essential soft skill in today’s apathetic society. On top of it, it builds public speaking confidence, as its syllabus is designed in such a way that students can express themselves effectively in front of the audience. Theme based writers and lyricists are the spot-on example of this. Hence, philosophy is indispensable part in curriculum and it must be compulsory.\\nIn conclusion, both the subjects and other similar ones must be compulsory at least up to the high school because they teach life skills to the students. Subsequently, they can be optional; hence, I oppose the argument.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'Some individuals opine that as parents do not spend much time at home and are instead busy at their workplace, adolescents are facing more difficulties in recent times than they encountered in days gone by. I strongly agree with this opinion.\\nMost children are obese these days and the rest are prone to obesity. The hectic lifestyle leaves no time for parents to cook at home so they end up feeding their children readymade meals. Since such unhealthy food products contain more calories, their children gradually put on weight and ultimately become extremely overweight.\\nJuvenile crime is also on the rise. Youngsters feel lonely when they are alone at home. To kill their boredom, they end up watching violent movies or playing violent games. Too much exposure to violent content make them more aggressive and increase their risk of committing crimes.\\nFurthermore, children are not respectful nowadays. Parents lack time to instil moral values in their offspring and that is why they learn the behaviour that they watch on the internet or on television. By contrast in the olden days, both parents and grandparents used to teach them how to behave properly as soon as they started walking and talking.\\nTo conclude, teens are suffering from several troubles because of the fact that their parents lead a busy lifestyle. Consequently, they are unhealthy, disrespectful and prone to committing crime.',\n","  'Online retail business has witnessed a boom over the last decade and now a days, a growing number of people are shopping from online stores instead of purchasing from physical stores. The major benefits of online shopping for customer are the convenience and time saving and for companies it saves millions of dollars that were spent in the past on the construction of stores. However, online shopping has drawbacks as well in the form of online fraud for both the customer and the vendor.\\nThe online shopping experience is more convenient and saves a lot of time of buyers because they are not required to visit a particular store to purchase a specific item. Whatever they need could be bought while sitting at home without any interruption from sales representatives. Companies are also finding this trend encouraging due to the reason that they are able to save the expenses they could have incurred on the construction of their stores. Hence, it becomes quite evident that online retail is advantageous for customers for its hassle free experience and companies also save a huge sum of money by not constructing their stores.\\nOn the other hand, online fraud has emerged as the biggest drawback of purchasing from online market places. There are still people in huge numbers that do not trust the products sold by online websites because in a few cases customers have received duplicate products. This has created a trust deficit between the customer and the supplier. Along with this, companies also remain under a constant threat of network breach which could potentially hack their entire website.\\nTo sum up, It is quiet true that people are inclining towards online shopping instead of conventional shopping, due to the better buying experience and time efficiency and also it has helped the companies save funds that they could have been spent on building the physical stores. However, online shopping has certain drawbacks like fraud and cyber threat which affect the customer and companies respectively.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.',\n","  'In today’s fast and advanced world everything is measured in terms of its monetary value. People’s obsession with materialistic things has increased so much in recent times that it has overruled their traditional values or bonding with their loved ones. In my opinion, the main reasons for this are the impact of social media and fake relationships made on it. A few people also stay away from their families to earn more for a lavish lifestyle which unfortunately disconnects them from their roots or values.\\nSocial media has created an urge in people to show off their material possessions in front of their friends and peers. Under this pressure, they are always stuck to their cellular device to maintain the fake standard and hardly interact with their real families or friends. For instance, the recent generation has advanced cell phones and gadgets, which keep them busy with games and cyberspace activities. Moreover, as they are connected to the internet all the time, people have started developing a relationship with strangers around the world on the basis of their attractive social media portfolio. For example, the rate of divorce is high in the case of marriages among couples who met each other online. This is because everybody has an attractive virtual profile but in reality they are totally different from who they pretend to be online.\\nThere are also many people who migrate to other countries leaving their roots and cultural values behind to earn more money. In this era of cutthroat competition, people at times leave their parents and family behind for monetary opportunity. For example, people with overnight social popularity, usually move to another city to pursue their fames and social media life. In addition, to maintain their standard on social media, people even borrow money to splurge on expensive gadgets, designer costumes and foreign goods.\\nIn a nutshell, society is getting more and more materialistic and everybody is after money and the comforts it can bring to them. Hence, I fully agree with the argument that we have stopped caring about the important things in life. Instead we are chasing name and wealth that we can show off in front of the world.\\nFollow us on Youtube for IELTS writing tips.'],\n"," [7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5,

[SEP] According to some people, it is better to educate students of different academic caliber together whereas others insist that students should be grouped on the basis of their learning abilities. In my opinion, it is important to teach all students together.\n","People who argue that there should be separate classes for bright and slow students believe that this segregation improves the performance of both groups. There is certainly a grain of truth in this argument. When all the students in a class are of the same academic caliber, it is easier for teachers to finish the lessons. This is beneficial for academically brilliant students as they do not have to waste their time waiting for other students to catch up. This arrangement can be beneficial for slow learners too. Teachers can devote more time to them and make sure that they have grasped the concepts before moving on to the next lesson. This is not exactly possible if the class has students of different learning capacities. In such situations, teachers will feel compelled to finish lessons faster.\n","On the other hand, the practice of separating students on the basis of their ability to learn is largely detrimental for their progress. The classroom is a microcosm of the world. Just as there are people of different skills and aptitudes in the real world, there should be children of all abilities in a classroom. In this arrangement, bright students can assist slow learners to pick up the concepts. This benefits both of them because teaching someone is the easiest way to enhance our knowledge. Another advantage of this arrangement is that it promotes a sense of equality among students. If slow learners are grouped together and taught in a separate class, it will make them feel inferior to the bright students. This sense of inferiority will further affect their progress and can have a detrimental effect on their confidence levels. Also, learning ability is just one of the different forms of intelligence. Just because a student is weak in physics or mathematics, it does not mean that they are unintelligent. They may be talented in other areas and as such their poor scores in a few subjects is no reason to put them in another class.\n","In conclusion, it is better to group students of different abilities together. It boosts their confidence levels and prepares them better for the future\n","{'input_ids': [101, 1792, 1106, 1199, 1234, 117, 1122, 1110, 1618, 1106, 18584, 1651, 1104, 1472, 3397, 17836, 1487, 6142,

Others opine that it is better to choose friends who disagree with us occasionally. In my opinion, we should have friends who sometimes agree and sometimes disagree with us.\n","Some people think it is good to have friends who have the same thought processes and likes and dislikes as them. It would help in taking decisions easily without much difference of opinion or conflict of interest. Friends with similar interests would usually be in sync in most situations and the relationship is easy going. For instance, if one has a set of friends who all prefer beach destinations, the travel plans become easier. Also, if everyone has a similar opinion on career, choices become simple. Hence, sometimes, people prefer friends who think alike.\n","On the other hand, it is good to have friends who have different opinions and who voice them as and when required. This gives an option to widen the knowledge base by learning from each other and looking from a different perspective put forth by the friend who is disagreeing. It also helps one be patient and open to hearing the other person’s opinion and then take a calculated decision. This decision taken would most likely be a win-win situation where both the parties’ opinions are factored in and a conclusion is arrived at.\n","To sum up/to conclude, while we may have all kinds of friends throughout life, I strongly opine that it is good to have friends who sometimes disagree.

Is leadership an innate skill? What other characteristics do companies look for in a manager?\n","Essay: Recruiters consider the applicant’s personality while selecting them for managerial roles. Leadership, good communication skills, empathy and good manners are a few important characteristics that companies expect from a manager. In my opinion, leadership is an acquired skill due to the reasons outlined below.\n","Nobody is born with the skill or talent to lead a group of people or a community. Experience from our lives helps us to learn and become a good leader. Taking initiatives and helping the group in various tasks and becoming a role model for them is possible only through repetitive practice. It is rare for a newbie to be successful in the first few attempts. For instance, Mahatma Gandhi was a remarkable leader and from his autobiography we can see that it was through his life experiences and practice that he learned the skills required to be a good leader. Therefore, I believe that leadership is not an inborn skill but an acquired one.\n","Along with leadership quality some other factors are also considered while selecting a good manager. These are good communication skills, empathetic nature and good manners. Firstly, good communication is extremely important for a leader as he needs to communicate effectively within his group as well as to the customers. In addition, empathy is an equally important characteristic for a manager because only then his subordinates or customers will feel free to express their feelings to him. Finally, the ability to maintain one’s cool even during tough times makes one an ideal choice for a manager.\n","For instance, managers may have to deal with tough clients and during such situations it is necessary for them to be calm and good mannered to cope with the situation and resolve it. Therefore, apart from leadership quality, all the other characteristics mentioned above are extremely important for a good manager. In conclusion, leadership is not an inherent skill but an acquired or learned one. Managers who possess leadership quality, communication skills, empathy and good manners will do utmost justice to their roles.\n","\n","Predicted mark: 7.268029689788818\n","Actual mark: 7.0\n"]}],"source":["# Making sanity check\n","question = test_df['question'].iloc[10]\n","essay = test_df['essay'].iloc[10]\n","mark = test_df['mark'].iloc[10]\n","\n","print(f'Question: {question}')\n","print(f'Essay: {essay}')\n","\n","encoding = tokenizer(question, essay, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)\n","input_ids = encoding['input_ids'].to(device)\n","attention_mask = encoding['attention_mask'].to(device)\n","\n","output = model(input_ids, attention_mask)\n","print(f'Predicted mark: {output[0].item()}')\n","print(f'Actual mark: {mark}')\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.836408Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.835758Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.875220Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.874030Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.836370Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicted mark: 7.732183933258057\n"]}],"source":["# Для интереса проверим оценку моего же эссе\n","question = '''\n","Young people who commit crimes should be treated the same as adults by the authorities.\n","To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n","'''\n","essay = '''\n","It is a common opinion that everyone should look the same in the eye of justice. However, it is my firm belief that adolescents should not be punished the same as adults by the law. This is because of their immaturity, negative effect of their surroundings, and underdeveloped intellect. \n","Firstly, young people are unable to comprehend the consequences of their actions. Children tend to do whatever they want without critically thinking about the results of their doings. As an example, one of the most common juvenile crimes is larceny. Children may steal money or products from a store unaware of the repercussions. For this reason, the punishment should be less strict compared to a one for an adult who is fully aware of their actions.\n","Another compelling reason to support my view is that children commit crimes because of negative influence of their environment. Adolescents misbehave because they learnt to do it from older people. Young persons develop their character by observing their role models such as parents and trying to copy them. If a child is growing up in a community that disregards law, it is very likely that they will learn to exhibit unlawful behaviour. As a result, instead of punishing juveniles, their community such as parents should be held responsible.\n","Finally, if to impose severe penalties on children as on adults, it will ruin their entire future. According to a recent research, a child’s brain development is most active before the age of 18. Therefore, it is vitaly important for a young person to attend an educational institution to learn crucial skills. Imprisoning a juvenile may prevent them from studying and, therefore, has detrimental effects on their future lives. For this reason, an alternative type of punishment such as community service must be used to handle crimes done by minors.\n","In summary, all crimes must be held accounted for, However, every social group should receive an appropriate type of penalty. That is, punishments for juveniles should not be severe as for adults because it can significantly damage their lives. \n","'''\n","\n","encoding = tokenizer(question, essay, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)\n","input_ids = encoding['input_ids'].to(device)\n","attention_mask = encoding['attention_mask'].to(device)\n","\n","output = model(input_ids, attention_mask)\n","print(f'Predicted mark: {output[0].item()}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.879433Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.879167Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.914462Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.913410Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.879407Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicted mark: 7.546204566955566\n"]}],"source":["# Проверим эссе моего друга)\n","question = '''\n","Young people who commit crimes should be treated the same as adults by the authorities.\n","To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n","'''\n","essay = '''\n","Nowadays, amount of crimes committed all over the world is decreasing, thus it is thought young people’s punishment for crimes should not differ from adults’ punishment. Were I asked about such suggestions, I would definitely decline all of them because of several reasons.\n","Firstly, teenagers often do not understand the consequences of their actions. The younger people can be easily manipulated by the older ones. Such manipulations can lead to the court’s mistake, resulting in imprisonment of the wrong person. There are well-known examples, such as the Georgetown experiment, that shows how easily young people are ruled by more experienced  adults. \n","Secondly, young criminals’ adoption to life after prison can be dramatically harder than adults’. This happens because while being in prison, the learning process is violated or even stopped, and proper education is essential for finding a nice job, and, therefore, socialization. On the other hand, adults mostly have families and friends, which can help them to resocialize.\n","Lastly, the guilt of teenagers often belongs to their parents. If all parents had paid more attention to their children, there would have been much less crimes committed by youngsters. With the lack of control and positive examples of parents’ communication, teenagers find their replacement in criminal groups. This situation can be observed in poor countries of Africa and Latin America, where parents cannot participate in their children’s lives.\n","Summarizing, teenagers who commit crimes should not be treated as strictly as adults, because youngsters often do not realize what they are doing, and if treated similarly to older criminals, have less chances to return to normal life.\n","'''\n","\n","encoding = tokenizer(question, essay, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)\n","input_ids = encoding['input_ids'].to(device)\n","attention_mask = encoding['attention_mask'].to(device)\n","\n","output = model(input_ids, attention_mask)\n","print(f'Predicted mark: {output[0].item()}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.921369Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.918743Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.965024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.963936Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-18T09:31:50.921322Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicted mark: 7.322418689727783\n"]}],"source":["# Эссе еще одного друга\n","question = '''\n","Young people who commit crimes should be treated the same as adults by the authorities.\n","To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n","'''\n","essay = '''\n","Being less conscious than adults, young people often misjudge the consequences of their actions.They could commit a crime without realizing the flaws behind it, because children are not developed in understanding long-term perspective.
